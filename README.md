# Video Game Analysis Mod for PowerPipe

Analyze video games data using MySQL and PowerPipe.

## Installation

Download and install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads) and MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
brew install turbot/tap/mysql
```

## Get the Dataset

Download the [Video Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beridzeg45/video-games).

## Enable MySQL server to read from local file

```sh
echo "local_infile = 1" >> /opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf
```

## Start MySQL server

```sh
brew services start mysql
```

## Create a MySQL Database

```sh
mysql -u root
create database my_database;
```

## Use the newly created Database

```sh
use my_database;
```

## Create a Table

```sh
create table game_data (
  title varchar(255),
  release_date date,
  developer varchar(255),
  publisher varchar(255),
  genres varchar(255),
  genres_splitted varchar(255),
  product_rating varchar(255),
  user_score float,
  user_ratings_count int,
  platforms_info text
);
```

## Load the Dataset into the Table

```sh
load data local infile '/path/to/your/all_video_games.csv'
into table game_data
fields terminated by ','
enclosed by '"'
lines terminated by '\n'
ignore 1 rows
(@title, @release_date, @developer, @publisher, @genres, @genres_splitted, @product_rating, @user_score, @user_ratings_count, @platforms_info)
set
   title = @title,
   release_date = str_to_date(@release_date, '%m/%d/%Y'),
   developer = @developer,
   publisher = @publisher,
   genres = @genres,
   genres_splitted = @genres_splitted,
   product_rating = @product_rating,
   user_score = nullif(@user_score, ''),
   user_ratings_count = nullif(@user_ratings_count, ''),
   platforms_info = @platforms_info;
```
